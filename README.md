## Installation

* Clone this directory
* Make an rhdir subdirectory
	* if you have a directory called ~/Dropbox/rhdir, make should link it for you
	* or you can just `mkdir`
	* I have one, but it's probably easier to let make clone things
* `make Lectures` to make the Lectures subdirectory (a separate repo)
* follow [those instructions](https://github.com/Bio3SS/Lectures/blob/master/README.md)
