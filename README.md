## Installation

* Clone this directory
* Make an rhdir subdirectory
	* recommended to use `mkdir`
	* rhdir Dropbox is deprecated
* `make Lectures` to make the Lectures subdirectory (a separate repo)
* follow [that repo's instructions](https://github.com/Bio3SS/Lectures/blob/master/README.md)

## Overview

schedule.md is where I'm now trying to keep track of timetables

Main directories

* Lectures
	* subLectures (older, tangled version, could be dropped soon)
* web
* Homework

Service directories

* exponential
* ts
* makestuff

## Status
* Still building this cleaner version (after frustrations with a deeply tangled submodule version)
* Not so clear how automatic things are (Installation instructions tested by Mike, but only for intro unit)
